# basic_streamlit_app

**Penguins basic streamlit app description**

**Project Overview**
---

This app uses data from the penguins.csv dataset. It allows users to explore 3 species of penguins from 3 islands observed between 2007 and 2009. Data includes the length and depth of bills in mm, flipper length in mm, body mass in g, sex, and year the datapoint was collected. Users can filter through the data either by species or by island.

**Instructions**
---

This app is not deployed on Streamlit Cloud. It must be run locally.

Running the app locally:

    Download the entire basic_streamlit_app folder including: main.py, README.md, and the data folder which includes the penguins.csv file.

    To launch the app:

    In the terminal: cd basic_streamlit_app (Depending on where the folder is saved, you may need to cd into other folders before you can cd into basic_streamlit_app folder)
    Then in the terminal, use the following command: streamlit run ./main.py

    This will default to opening a new tab in your primary web browser. This tab will load the Streamlit app.

**App Features**
---

Users can filter the data both by species and by island. This will allow a more finetuned experience when exploring the data.
