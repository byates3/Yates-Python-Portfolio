Project 1

The goal of this project was to create a basic streamlit app. It allows users to explore data on different species of penguins. More information can be found in the project's README.md.

Project 2
---
This project aims to demonstrate principles of data tidying. Using data from X-Men comic issues between the 1960s and 1990s, this project demonstrates how to tidy up and visualize data. Like Project 1, a Streamlit app is used to display and visualize the data.
