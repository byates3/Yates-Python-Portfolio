# Yates-Python-Portfolio

This repository will serve as a portfolio for all my own data science projects. Projects are organized into individual project folders.

Project 1
---
The goal of this project was to create a basic streamlit app. It allows users to explore data on different species of penguins. More information can be found in the project's README.md.

Project 2
---
This project aims to demonstrate principles of data tidying. Using data from X-Men comic issues between the 1960s and 1990s, this project demonstrates how to tidy up and visualize data. Like Project 1, a Streamlit app is used to display and visualize the data.

Project 3
---
This project is a Streamlit app that enables users to explore Named Entity Recognition (NER) with their own chosed piece of text. Users can add their own custom patterns and labels, and the app has been deployed on the Streamlit Cloud.
