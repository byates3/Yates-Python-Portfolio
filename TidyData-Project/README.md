**Mutant Moneyball Tidy Data Project**

**Project Overview**
---
The goal of this project is to take a messy dataset, including missing values, variables sharing columns, etc., and transforming it into neat, easy to work with data. This will be done through a number of different methods including creating new tables, creating and reordering columns, and visualizing the data. Moreover, this project aims to demonstrate the importance of data tidying. Information on data tidying can be found under the "References Used" section. 

This project can be understood from the Python file alone, but for stronger data visualization, I recommend launching this project in Streamlit.

**Dataset Description**
---
The data used describes the value of X-Men comics from the 1960s through the 1990s according to four different sellers: Heritage, eBay, Wiz, and oStreet.

**Instructions**
---
Download the mutant_moneyball.csv file found in the project folder. It must run alongside the Python code. 

To launch this project in streamlit, navigate to the terminal, cd to the TidyData-Project folder, and run Streamlit for the TidyData.py file. 

This project is dependant on four libraries:
1. Pandas
2. matplotlib.pyplot
3. Seaborn
4. Streamlit

Ensure that all four libraries are imported correctly:
1. pandas as pd
2. matplotlib.pyplot as plt
3. seaborn as sns
4. streamlit as st
